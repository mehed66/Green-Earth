     **forEach() => Purpose: Runs a function for each element in the array.**
     **map() => Purpose: Transforms each element of an array and creates a new array with the results.**

4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?

**In ES6, destructuring assignment lets you unpack values from arrays or objects into variables in a very clean way.**

5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?
